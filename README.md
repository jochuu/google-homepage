:::Self Reflection:::
This was harder than it initially looked and involved lots of tweaking with flexboxes to see how they affected the site. Overall though, the project was not too difficult and I learnt a lot about using git, especially with regards to having to commit often, leave meaningful messages and ammending commits if they were wrong.
